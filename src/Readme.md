1. **prop_syntax.lean** : It contains the syntax for the propositional language. It is needed because we will use propositional tautologies to define normal logics.
2. **syntax.lean** : It contains the syntax for the basic modal language, and how the propositional language is a sublanguage of the basic modal language.
3. **kripke_semantics.lean** : It defines truth and validity
4. **normal_logics.lean** : It defines normal logics from the 'bottom-up' approach and contains basic results about them. It also describes the 'top-down' approach of defining normal logics.
5. **top_down_proofs** : It contains the proofs of some results which use the 'top-down' approach of defining normal logics. It also establishes that the 'top-down' and the 'bottom-up' approach result in the same set.
